# Workroom Architecture

> Public naming: Workrooms are collaboration contexts. They organize threads,
> links, events, and shared visibility; they are not a third orchestration
> concept beside **Agents** and **Workflows**. See
> [Orchestration Terminology](ORCHESTRATION_TERMINOLOGY.md).

## Purpose

Workrooms are CodeWhale's chat-native abstraction for durable, addressable
threads of agent work. They sit between the Runtime API's transient thread
model and the user-facing surfaces (TUI, mobile, chat bridges).

This is a draft v0.9 architecture note. In v0.8.62, only the protocol data
types and link parser are present. Runtime endpoints, persistent state, mobile
rendering, and model-visible link resolution are planned follow-ups.

## Data flow

1. **Creation.** A future workroom is created when a thread is started with a
   workroom context (title, workspace, external refs). The workroom id
   is stable and can be shared as a `codewhale://workroom/...` link.

2. **Event publication.** Each agent action (tool call, approval, failure)
   is recorded as a `WorkroomEvent` in the workroom's event log. Events
   carry `AgentAttribution` metadata tracing which provider, model, and
   agent produced them.

3. **Link resolution.** When a `codewhale://workroom/...` link appears in
   a chat surface, a future `resolve_workroom_link` tool (or API endpoint)
   parses it and returns scoped context: thread metadata, external refs,
   and recent event summaries. The calling model can then decide whether
   to read the full thread transcript.

4. **Listing.** A future `/workrooms` endpoint returns a summary of all visible
   workrooms (id, title, updated_at, active thread count). Surfaces
   consume this for inbox/recent-activity views.

## State store

Persisted workroom state should live alongside existing CodeWhale state:

```
~/.codewhale/
├── workrooms/
│   ├── wr_abc123.json     # Workroom metadata + event log
│   └── wr_def456.json
├── threads/               # Existing thread state (unchanged)
├── checkpoints/
├── config.toml
└── ...
```

Each `.json` file would contain the workroom metadata (`Workroom` struct),
a list of `WorkroomThread` descriptors, and a bounded set of recent
`WorkroomEvent` records. This state store is not implemented yet.

## Crate responsibilities

| Crate | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `codewhale-protocol` | Types: `Workroom`, `WorkroomId`, `WorkroomThread`, `WorkroomEvent`, `WorkroomLink`, `ExternalThreadRef`, `AgentAttribution` |
| `codewhale-app-server` | Future endpoints: `GET /workrooms`, `GET /workroom/:id/threads`, `GET /workroom/resolve` |
| `codewhale-tui` | Future model-facing link resolution and optional sidebar inbox |
| `codewhale-state` | Future: persistent workroom store (Phase 2) |
